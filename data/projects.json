    "fullDescription": "Portfolio site built with Next.js 15 and React 19 using the App Router and static export (SSG). Features Motion-powered page transitions and scroll animations, a canvas particle mesh background, glass-morphism UI with Tailwind CSS v4 theming, and a JSON data layer split across server and client components for fast, filterable project browsing.",
    "problem": "Keeping a portfolio updated required code changes, and the previous SPA lacked the performance and SEO benefits of static generation.",
    "solution": "Migrated to Next.js 15 with static export so every page is pre-rendered at build time; added Motion animation presets for smooth transitions, tag/category/search filtering, and a canvas particle mesh for visual polish.",
    "architecture": "Next.js 15 App Router + React 19; static export (SSG); Tailwind CSS v4 theming; Motion (Framer Motion) animation presets; canvas particle mesh background; JSON data layer with server/client component split.",
    "challenges": "Orchestrating Motion entrance and exit animations across route changes; tuning canvas particle physics for smooth 60 fps rendering; managing server/client component boundaries to keep the bundle small; respecting reduced-motion preferences.",
    "results": "Fast static pages with near-instant navigation; smooth page transitions and scroll-triggered animations; interactive particle background that responds to pointer movement; accessible motion preferences respected throughout.",

Covers 5 categories — Sorting (6), Pathfinding (5), Graph (5), Data Structures (6), and Machine Learning (5) — each with dedicated custom hooks. Features a neon dark theme, real-time complexity analysis, and interactive playback controls.",
    "problem": "Learning algorithms from textbooks provides static examples without seeing how data structures evolve during execution.",
    "solution": "Migrated to Next.js 14 with static export and built a generator-based step engine for step-by-step algorithm playback. Each algorithm family uses dedicated custom hooks, and the neon UI provides clear visual feedback across all visualization types.",

    "title": "VPSGuard",
    "shortDescription": "ML-first VPS log security analyzer that detects distributed attacks like botnets and credential stuffing that rule-based tools miss.",
    "fullDescription": "VPSGuard is an intelligent security analyzer for VPS authentication logs that combines traditional rule-based detection with machine learning to catch sophisticated distributed attacks. Unlike tools like fail2ban that rely solely on pattern matching, VPSGuard uses an IsolationForest ML model trained on clean baseline data to detect anomalous behavior patterns indicative of coordinated botnets, credential stuffing campaigns, and novel attack vectors. Features 7 detection rules, 5 log format parsers, GeoIP integration for geographic velocity detection, a watch daemon for continuous monitoring, and multiple output formats.",
    "problem": "Traditional security tools like fail2ban use static rules that miss distributed attacks where individual IPs stay under thresholds but collectively pose a threat. Botnets, credential stuffing, and coordinated attacks evade per-IP detection.",
    "solution": "Built a dual-detection system combining 7 configurable rules with an IsolationForest ML model. Rules catch known patterns while filtering flagged events from ML training data. The ML model learns normal baseline behavior and flags statistical anomalies, catching attacks that rules miss.",
    "architecture": "Python CLI built with Typer and Rich for terminal output. Modular pipeline: Parsers normalize 5 log formats into AuthEvent objects; RuleEngine applies detection rules; MLEngine extracts 10 features per IP and runs IsolationForest anomaly detection; Reporters output to terminal, JSON, Markdown, or HTML. SQLite persistence for analysis history and watch state. Protocol-based abstractions enable extensibility.",
    "challenges": "Designing ML features that capture distributed attack patterns (coordinated timing, username entropy, cross-source activity). Preventing baseline poisoning by excluding rule-flagged events from training. Building cross-platform log rotation detection for the watch daemon. Balancing sensitivity to catch real attacks without excessive false positives.",
    "results": "Detects coordinated botnet attacks that fail2ban misses by analyzing temporal patterns and cross-IP correlation. Explainable anomaly scores show which features drove detection. Watch daemon enables continuous monitoring with configurable alert thresholds. 355 tests ensure reliability across parsers, rules, ML, and reporting.",

Provides a pre-configured foundation with dual JWT tokens (access + refresh) and Redis-based revocation, async SQLAlchemy 2.0 with PostgreSQL, rate limiting, security headers, role-based access control, and Docker Compose for local and production environments. Clone it and start building features immediately without re-solving auth, database, or deployment setup.",
    "problem": "Every new API project starts from zero — re-implementing auth, database config, and Docker setup wastes time and introduces inconsistencies across projects.",

    "challenges": "Designing fail-closed token revocation so Redis downtime rejects tokens rather than accepting them; handling race conditions on unique constraints during concurrent registration; protecting login against timing attacks by always executing bcrypt even for missing users; enforcing strong password policy without degrading UX.",
    "results": "Reusable foundation that eliminates boilerplate for new API projects; fail-closed security ensures tokens are rejected if Redis is unavailable; comprehensive test suite with async SQLite and fake Redis mocks; served as the base for the Analytics Dashboard project.",
