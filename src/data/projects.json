    "shortDescription": "Data-driven React + Vite portfolio with routed pages, filters, and JSON-sourced content.",
    "fullDescription": "Modern portfolio site built with Vite and React Router, driven entirely by a JSON data layer so projects can be edited without touching components. Includes responsive layouts, tag/category filters, search, and highlighted projects on the home page.",
    "problem": "Keeping a portfolio updated required code changes and lacked structured metadata for filtering.",
    "solution": "Centralized project data in JSON with reusable cards and detail pages; added search, tags, and categories to help viewers find relevant work quickly.",
    "architecture": "Vite + React + React Router front end; JSON data source; custom hooks for filtering, search, and sorting; responsive layout with shared theme tokens.",
    "challenges": "Designing components that stay readable across screen sizes; keeping filters intuitive on mobile; ensuring data changes flow through without rebuilds.",
    "results": "Content updates happen in minutes with no component edits; recruiters can filter by tags and categories; highlighted projects surface automatically on the home page.",

    "shortDescription": "Interactive web platform for visualizing algorithms across sorting, pathfinding, graph, data structures, and machine learning.",
    "fullDescription": "Comprehensive algorithm visualization platform built with React and TypeScript that brings complex algorithms to life through step-by-step animations. Features 5 main categories with 20+ algorithms including sorting algorithms, pathfinding algorithms, graph algorithms, data structures, and machine learning algorithms. Each visualization includes real-time complexity analysis and interactive controls.",
    "problem": "Learning algorithms from textbooks provides static examples without seeing how data structures evolve during execution.",
    "solution": "Created an interactive platform that visualizes algorithm execution step-by-step with animations, allowing users to control speed, pause, and see complexity metrics in real-time.",
    "architecture": "React + TypeScript front end with Vite; modular algorithm implementations; custom hooks for state management; Tailwind CSS for responsive UI; category-based routing system.",
    "challenges": "Coordinating animations across different algorithm types; managing complex state for visualizations; ensuring smooth performance during animations; creating intuitive controls for diverse algorithm families.",
    "results": "Educational tool that makes abstract algorithms tangible; users can understand algorithm behavior visually; complexity metrics help with analysis; platform supports adding new algorithms easily.",
